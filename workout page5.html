<h1>Bodyweight squats</h1>
<h3>Bodyweight squats can increase lower body and core strength as they work the abs, buttocks, hips, thighs, calves, and shins.</h3>
<h2>How to do them:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Stand with the feet slightly wider than hip-width apart, angling the toes slightly outward.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Keep the hands down by the sides, with the palms facing in and keep the shoulders back.	</li>
	<br>
	<li>Engage the abdominal muscles to support the back.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Shift the hips back and bend the knees as though taking a seat, keeping a flat back.	</li>
	<br>
	<li>Keep lowering down to the ground until the thighs are parallel with the floor.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Push through the feet to straighten back up into the starting position.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Inhale into the squat, then exhale when standing back up.</li>
</ol
